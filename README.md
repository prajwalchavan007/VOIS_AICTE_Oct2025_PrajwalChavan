Airbnb is a popular platform where property owners rent out their homes or apartments to travelers. One of the biggest challenges for hosts is deciding the right price for their listings, since prices vary depending on several factors such as the number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, cleanliness, accuracy of descriptions, a communication quality with guests.

# Project Description 

This project aims to develop a machine learning model that predicts Airbnb listing prices. Accurate pricing is essential for both hosts and guestsâ€”hosts seek to optimize their revenue and occupancy rates, while travelers look for fair and competitive rates. By analyzing historical Airbnb data, the project builds a regression model that identifies how various factors such as the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, and guest ratings influence the listing price.The trained model can then estimate prices for new or potential listings, enabling property owners to set data-driven and competitive prices.
